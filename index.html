               <ul>

               <li class="item 1">As a senior member of the staff, I helped integrate new ownership into their new-found roles by instructing them on current working methods, employee roles and responsibilities, “Point-of-Sales” system tutorials, and management protocol, resulting in a smooth transition between previous ownership and current.</li>

                <li class="item 2">Furthermore, by helping identify less productive methods in day-to-day logistics and processes and by collaborating to produce more effective ones, both management and staff increased productivity and sales.</li>

               <li class="item3">Working with management, I helped to generate new promotions, specials, and recipes and we were successful in attracting not only new customers, but a whole new demographic of customers.</li>
